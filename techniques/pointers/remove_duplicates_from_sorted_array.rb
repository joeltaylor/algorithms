# Task:
# Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element
# appear only once and return the new length
#
# Do not allocate space for another array, you must do this in place with
# constant memory.
#
# Input: [1,1,2]
# Output: 2 (
# The first 2 elements be [1,2] and what comes after that doesn't matter.
#
# Notes:
# Two components immediately stand out about this challenge â€” the array is
# already sorted and we need to return the length of the unique array so that
# the element could be sliced to give back a unique array.
#
# A sorted array means that it's simple to check for duplicates. All we need to
# do is look ahead and we'll know whether or nor there duplicates are present.
#
# Needing to order modify the array in place means tells us that we need to keep
# track of two things: the index of the integer we're checking (which also gives
# us the index of where to put the next interger) and the index of the location
# we're checking. This is a perfect example of a slow-pointer and a
# fast-pointer.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# Returns {Integer}
#
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
